# Hack Game
A game that copies the hacking minigame from NieR:Automata. Uses C++ and OpenGL

## Assembly
The project uses Cmake to build, install it if necessary. The GLEW, GLFW, GLM, and SOIL libraries are also used.

Installing the necessary libraries for linux:
```
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libglm-dev libsoil-dev
```

For Windows, download all the libraries yourself
